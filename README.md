<h2> Hello, Teads!</h2>

<p>Here to tell you about how I solved the second-price, sealed-bid auction problem.</p>

### Chosen technology  

```javascript
const auctionApp = {
  platform: "Android",
  code: "100% Kotlin",
  libraries: [Dagger-Hilt, Room, Coroutines, ViewModel, LiveData],
  architecture: [Clean-Architecture, Model-View-ViewModel, Solid-Principles],
  testingTools: {
                    unitTest: "JUnit & Mockk & GWT",
                    androidTest: "Espresso & Robot-Pattern"
                },
  style: "8bit",
  sideQuest: "I took the chance to try Dagger-Hilt and Coroutines
              instead of libraries I'm used to, such as Koin and RxJava"
}
```

### And it looks like this...

<p>Feel free to clone the project and run it locally.</p>
<p>If you want to see the algorithm and its tests already, you can get it <a href="https://github.com/anatideo/second-price-sealed-bid-auction/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/anatideo/challenge/teads/domain/GetAuctionResultUseCase.kt">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/anatideo/second-price-sealed-bid-auction/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/anatideo/challenge/teads/domain/GetAuctionResultUseCaseTest.kt">here</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, I created <a href="https://github.com/anatideo/second-price-sealed-bid-auction/issues">a list of issues<a/> to give you perspective about stuff which could be made in the project, but weren't because a matter of time. If you wish to see something in the project which was not made, please, let me know and I'll send an update.</p>
